    <h1> Bird Migration</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>some passages about migratory birds of rajasthan </h2>
    <p>Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement, 
        often north and south along a flyway, between breeding 
        and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. 
        Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, 
        including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily
        by the availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern 
        hemisphere, where birds are funneled onto specific routes by
        natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.
    </p>
    <p>Migration of species such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows was
        recorded as many as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors, including 
        Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job. More recently, Johannes Leche
        began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749,
        and modern scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing
        and satellite tracking to trace migrants. Threats to migratory birds have 
        grown with habitat destruction, especially of stopover and wintering sites,
        as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.

    <p>The Arctic tern holds the long-distance migration record for birds, traveling 
        between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year. Some species of 
        tubenoses (Procellariiformes) such as albatrosses circle the earth, flying over 
        the southern oceans, while others such as Manx shearwaters migrate 14,000 km (7,600 nmi)
        between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations
        are common, while longer ones are not. The shorter migrations include altitudinal
        migrations on mountains such as the Andes and Himalayas.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length.
         Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars, the
          earth's magnetic field, and mental maps.
